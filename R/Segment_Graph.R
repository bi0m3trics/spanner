#' Segment a terrestrial point cloud using graph theory.
#'
#' `segment_graph` returns a .las object with a new column "treeID".
#'
#' Preforms Individual tree segmentation following ecological principles for “growing” trees
#' based on these input locations in a graph-theory approach inspired by work of Tao and
#' others (2015). Point coordinates are linked together based on proximity and turned into
#' a connected graph object, using the estimated tree bole locations as origin points, connecting individual
#' points back to those tree bole origins based on shortest paths within the graph network, and finally
#' assigning those points a unique tree identification based on the bole coordinate for which
#' they are connected. Input point cloud is subsampled to a lower resolution before processing to
#' increase processing efficiency. However, graph objects can still get large quite rapidly. Take
#' this into consideration when choosing the extent of the input las object.
#'
#' @param las LAS normalized las object.
#' @param tree.locations data.frame A data.frame contained the following seed information: `TreeID`,
#' `X`, `Y`, `Z`, and `Radius` in the same units as the .las, output from the raster_eigen function.
#' @param k integer Number of nearest neighbors to be used in processing (k >= 50 suggested)
#' @param distance.threshold numeric Maximum distance (in the same units as the .las) under which
#' two points are connected in the graph object (greater than point spacing). Two points with a greater
#' distance than this threshold are not connected in the graph for processing.
#' @param plot_radius numeric Radius (in the same units as the .las) used to define a region of
#' interest for processing
#' @param use.metabolic.scale bool Use of weights in the assignment of points to a given treeID. Useful
#' when interlocking crowns are present and trees are of different sizes.
#' @param metabolic.scale.function string Supply your own function for defining segmentation weights
#' based on a function of estimated tree diameter (e.g. metabolic.scale.function = 'x/2'). use.metabolic.scale
#' must be set to TRUE. If not supplied, defaults to metabolic scale function from Tao et al., 2015.
#' @param subsample.graph numeric The subsampled point spacing to use during processing. Note: processing
#' time increases quickly with smaller point spacing with negligible returns in accuracy.
#' @param return.dense bool Decision to return the subsampled point cloud or assign treeIDs back to
#' points in the input dense point cloud.
#' @param output_location character Where to save processing outputs (rasters).
#'
#' @return a .las with the column treeID added.
