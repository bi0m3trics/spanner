Definition of spanner
<br/>1 (chiefly British): WRENCH
<br/>2: a wrench that has a hole, projection, or hook at one or both ends of the head for engaging with a corresponding device on the object that is to be turned
<br/>3: utilities to support landscape-, forest-, and tree-related data collection, manipulation, analysis, modelling, and visualization.

The following is the full processing pipeline described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13122297">Donager et al. (2021)</a>, and provides an example from downloading an example dataset, preprocesing it using lidR's functionality, estimating tree locations and DBH by rasterizing individual point cloud values of relative neighborhood density (at 0.3 and 1 m radius) and verticality within a slice of the normalized point cloud around breast height to 
(1.37 m), to individual tree segmentation following ecological principles for “growing” trees based on input locations in a graph-theory approach. Relies heavily on work of <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720304314">Roussel et al (2020)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271615002373?via%3Dihub">Tao and others (2015)</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169917301114?via%3Dihub">de Conto et al.
