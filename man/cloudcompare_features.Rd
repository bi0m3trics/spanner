\title{Compute geometric features with CloudCompare compatibility}
\usage{
cloudcompare_features(las, radius = 0.1, ncpu = 8, features = NULL)
}
\value{
A data.table with CloudCompare-compatible feature names
}
\description{
Alias for geometric_features_optimized() that provides CloudCompare-style
feature computation with the exact same interface as CloudCompare's "Compute geometric features" tool.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# CloudCompare-style usage
features <- cloudcompare_features(las, radius = 0.1)

# Specific features like CloudCompare interface
curvature_features <- cloudcompare_features(las, radius = 0.1,
  features = c("mean_curvature", "gaussian_curvature", "roughness"))
}
